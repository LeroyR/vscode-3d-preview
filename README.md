## Description

This extension is inspired by [vscode-3dviewer](https://github.com/stef-levesque/vscode-3dviewer) but has minimal features to preview triangular meshes and point clouds.

## Features

This extension supports 3D formats equally as [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/docs/0.9.0/tutorial/Basic/file_io.html) (but partly not supported currently).

| obj | o | o |
| off | o | o |
| pcd | o | x |
| ply | o | o |
| stl | x | o |

## FAQ

* Q. When I drag and drop a mesh file, a blank display is shown.
    * A. To show 3D data using this extension, you should first open a workspace including the 3D data that you want to open.
